# Random Chatting App

This is a small project of mine - a random chatting app built in Flutter. The app connects users randomly, allowing them to chat and transfer images to each other. To address the potential issue of a single user being online with no one to chat with initially, I've implemented a temporary "chat_bridge."

## Chat Bridge

The chat bridge serves as a connection between my chat server and an Omegle chat. This ensures that users can engage in conversations on Omegle while there are no other users online within my app. 

Please note that this project was developed quickly, in approximately a week. While you're welcome to reuse the code, be aware that it may not be optimized to the highest standards. This was more of a quick and fun project.

Feel free to explore the code and adapt it to your needs!

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Run the app
4. Enjoy random chatting and image transfers!

## Disclaimer

This project is not intended for production use, and the code may not be optimized. It was created for experimentation and as a quick, fun project.
